# Actitvities on Udacity
This repo will be used from myself for code that is have written during my udacity lessons.
The code will mainly be written in python or c++.

## I. Udacity - Intro to Self Driving Car Engineer(ISDCE)
 1. Matrix calculation (Python)
 2. Kalman Filters(Python)
 3. Translate a programm from python into C++
 4. A robot sensing demo(C++)
 5. Important issues to improve code (C++)
 6. Implementation of a A* search pathfinder algorithm (python)
 7. ImageProcessing with OpenCV (Python)
 8. A Trafficlight classifier(Python)
 9. A jupiter notebook example for online learnings

# Clean Code Development(CCD)
This section is just for me as a reminder to gather informations concerning the clean code development
i came across during my buisness life. Perhaps some of you will also find the links intresting for code development
especially if you are into java, c#, c/c++
